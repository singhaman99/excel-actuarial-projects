## 1. Dynamic Policyholder Behaviour Modelling Tool

### Description
This model simulates policyholder actions—such as lapses and surrenders—over time. It incorporates interest rate differentials and policy durations to estimate dynamic lapse rates and their impact on insurance portfolios.

### Features
- Time-dependent lapse modeling
- Interest rate sensitivity analysis
- User-adjustable parameters

### Inputs
- Policy duration
- Interest rate assumptions
- Policyholder behavior coefficients

### Outputs
- Projected lapse/surrender rates over time
- Sensitivity reports

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (with formulas, data tables, and charts)

## 2. Pension Plan Valuation Model with COLA Adjustments

### Description
An Excel model to calculate the present value of pension benefits considering cost-of-living adjustments (COLA), salary growth, mortality, and retirement age.

### Features
- COLA and salary growth integration
- Mortality-adjusted life expectancy calculations
- Discounted benefit projections

### Inputs
- Retirement age
- COLA rate
- Salary growth rate
- Discount rate
- Mortality table

### Outputs
- Projected pension payouts
- Present value of future benefits

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (with lookup functions, mortality table integration, and present value formulas)

## 3. Life Insurance Premium Calculator

### Description
Calculates net single and level annual premiums based on actuarial assumptions, using principles of life contingencies.

### Features
- Support for both term and whole life policies
- Age-based premium calculation
- Mortality and interest rate integration

### Inputs
- Age at policy issue
- Policy term
- Interest rate
- Mortality assumptions (qx or lx)

### Outputs
- Net single premium (NSP)
- Net level annual premium (NLAP)

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (formulas for life insurance mathematics)

## 4. Excel Annuity Calculator

### Description
A flexible calculator for modeling annuities and loan amortization, applying time value of money principles to simulate real-world cash flows.

### Features
- Loan amortization schedule generation
- Present and future value calculations
- Customizable frequency and term options

### Inputs
- Initial principal
- Interest rate
- Payment term
- Payment frequency

### Outputs
- Amortization schedule
